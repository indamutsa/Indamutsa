- 👋 Hi, I’m indamutsa
- 👀A research and development engineer with diverse expertise in model-driven engineering, software engineering, cloud computing, computer vision, and machine learning. I also have 6+ years of experience as a full-stack developer working with frameworks such as Next.js, Django, Flask, Spring Framework, React.js, and Node.js. 
- I'm also well-versed in DevOps engineering with Git-related approaches and technologies, containerization techs such as Docker, orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, and centralized monitoring, logging, and access control on distributed systems. I am well familiar with cloud-based architectures and Cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. 
- I have a solid experience in artificial intelligence in fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and big data analytics with languages such as C++ and Python and their related libraries such as OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
- Currently involved in multiple AI/blockchain/distributed system projects with the goal of creating meaningful products using cutting-edge techs. In my free time, I enjoy exploring nature by hiking or running trails, as well as attending tech meetups to explore new trends. 

- 💞️ I'm looking forward to collaborating on competitive IT projects.
